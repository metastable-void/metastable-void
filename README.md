## TL;DR

1. I am now **messing around with computers/networks, with a non-techy personal background originally**.
1. Although I do not want to disregard others' identities, I am happy with just being myself, and do not like others making useless arguments about something I appear to identify myself as.
   - **Nationality**: I am not regarding myself as being Japanese. I grow up in Japan, and I am a native speaker of Japanese language, I have an Asian-looking appearance, I live in Japan now, and just that. I act for my ethical duties I believe in, and not for some specific nation/goverment. I do have some interests in Japan because I live in Japan, but that does not necessarily match ones of Japan.
   - **Religion**: I am a less religious person with strong Christianity influences.
1. I am **open to job opportunities**.

## My name
My legal name is Yuka MORI. (My first name is Yuka)

### 真空
Usually, I am called with '真空' or its variations:

- **真空** (in Japanese) (on-yomi) Shinku / しんくう /ˈsinkuu/, pitch: HLLL \[ɕiŋkɯ̟ː\] (but commonly LHHH)
- **真空** (in Japanese) (kun-yomi) Masora / まそら /masoraˈ/, pitch: LHH \[mäso̞ɾä\]
- **真空** (in Chinese) (Mandarin Chinese) Zhēnkōng

This word literally means "vacuum", with '真' meaning 'true' and '空' meaning 'emptiness'.

### Handles & Alternative Names
I also use the Latin transliteration of 真空: **Vericava** (true emptiness).

I use the word `metastable-void`/`metastable.void`/`metastable_void` sometimes for usernames.

I have an alternative name `@` (At or あっと).

## Language Profile (Short Version)

I am a multilingual professional who uses English for technical and research work, and Japanese for everyday and workplace communication. My language use changes by domain rather than by nationality, and I often switch between Japanese and English depending on the people I’m talking to, especially in multilingual environments.

I process language mainly through sound and context, which makes my spoken communication strong. However, I have some orthographic weaknesses in Japanese, such as difficulty recalling kanji readings in isolation or writing them by hand. These issues show up mainly in test-like situations, not in real communication or comprehension.

I frequently interact with colleagues and friends from diverse backgrounds, including many L1 Chinese speakers, so I often use a mix of Japanese and English to ensure clarity. I also sometimes struggle with listening accuracy when conversations involve rapid switching, unclear articulation, or multiple accents, which is related to cognitive load rather than proficiency.

Overall, I am an audio-dominant, context-driven multilingual communicator with strong practical abilities in both English and Japanese, and some limitations in kanji recall and listening under high load.
