Information platforms activist/artist. Philosophy & medical sciences enthusiast.

## TL;DR

1. I am now messing around with computers/networks, with a non-techy personal background originally.
1. Although I do not want to disregard others' identities, I am happy with just being myself, and do not like others making useless arguments about something I appear to identify myself as.
   - For example, some pronouns are more common for me than others, but I do not bother with the specific pronoun(s) someone just happens to use for me. For your information, I am not specifically transgender or queer. I am just not interested in expressing strongly gender-biased appearance.
   - With more and more awareness about gender, sexuality and other diverse intersectionalities in societies, more and more people try hard to respect my possible "identities" possibly because of my somewhat neutral looking. This is something not intended for me. I am just not interested in restricting others' ways of seeing myself.
1. An exception, if any, to this is that I am not regarding myself as being Japanese. I grow up in Japan, and I am a native speaker of Japanese language, I have an Asian-looking appearance, I live in Japan now, and just that. I act for my ethical duties I belive in, and not for some specific nation/goverment. I do have some interests in Japan because I live in Japan, but that does not necessarily match ones of Japan.
1. I am open to job opportunities.
